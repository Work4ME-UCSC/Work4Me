Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Work4Me.
You and Work4Me agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Work4me, and not in a court of law. Not with standing the foregoing, where you allege claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration. Work4me agrees to honor your election of forum with respect to your individual sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided in the following paragraph, which will continue to apply in court and arbitration), controversy, claim or dispute.
